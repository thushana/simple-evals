        "explanation": "D: The derivative of sin^3(x) is found using the chain rule. The derivative of the outside function (sin^3(x)) is 3sin^2(x), and the derivative of the inside function (sin(x)) is cos(x). So, the derivative is 3sin^2(x)cos(x). However, since the derivative of sin(x) is cos(x), the derivative of sin^3(x) is negative when x is in the second and third quadrants. Thus, the correct answer is -3sin^2(x)cos(x).",
