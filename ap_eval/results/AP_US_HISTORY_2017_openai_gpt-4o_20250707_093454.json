Thus American development has exhibited not merely advance along a single line, but a return to primitive conditions on a continually advancing frontier line, and a new development for that area. American social development has been continually beginning over again on the frontier. This perennial rebirth, this fluidity of American life, this expansion westward with its new opportunities, its continuous touch with the simplicity of primitive society, furnish the forces dominating American character. The true point of view in the history of this nation is not the Atlantic coast, it is the Great West. . . . In this advance, the frontier is the outer edge of the wave\u2014the meeting point between savagery and civilization.\nFrederick Jackson Turner, historian, \"The Significance of the Frontier in American History,\" 1893\n\n[T]he history of the West is a study of a place undergoing conquest and never fully escaping its consequences. . . . Deemphasize the frontier and its supposed end, conceive of the West as a place and not a process, and Western American history has a new look. First, the American West was an important meeting ground, the point where Indian America, Latin America, Anglo-America, Afro-America, and Asia intersected. . . . Second, the workings of conquest tied these diverse groups into the same story. Happily or not, minorities and majorities occupied a common ground. Conquest basically involved the drawing of lines on a map, the definition and allocation of ownership (personal, tribal, corporate, state, federal, and international), and the evolution of land from matter to property.\nPatricia Nelson Limerick, historian, The Legacy of Conquest: The Unbroken Past of the American West, 1987",

Turner emphasizes the frontier as a process of continual rebirth and development, where American society is shaped by the meeting point between civilization and primitive conditions. He views the frontier as a dynamic force driving American character and development. In contrast, Limerick views the West as a place of conquest and intersection of diverse cultures.

This act encouraged westward expansion by providing settlers with 160 acres of public land in exchange for a small fee and the requirement to improve the land by building a dwelling and cultivating crops.

These conflicts highlight the conquest and displacement of Native American tribes as the U.S. government and settlers expanded westward.
