        "question_context": "In 1739 arrived among us from Ireland the Reverend Mr. [George] Whitefield, who had made himself remarkable there as an itinerant preacher. He was at first permitted to preach in some of our churches; but the clergy, taking a dislike to him, soon refused him their pulpits, and he was obliged to preach in the fields. The multitudes of all sects and denominations that attended his sermons were enormous. . . . It was wonderful to see the change soon made in the manners of our inhabitants. From being thoughtless or indifferent about religion, it seemed as if all the world were growing religious, so that one could not walk thro' the town in an evening without hearing psalms sung in different families of every street.\" Benjamin Franklin, The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin",

        "explanation": "The excerpt describes how Whitefield's preaching, which originated in Ireland and spread to the American colonies, demonstrates the trans-Atlantic nature of religious movements during this period. His ability to draw large crowds from various denominations shows how religious ideas and practices were being exchanged across the Atlantic."
