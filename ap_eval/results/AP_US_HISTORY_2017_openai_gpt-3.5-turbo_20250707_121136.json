Thus American development has exhibited not merely advance along a single line, but a return to primitive conditions on a continually advancing frontier line, and a new development for that area. American social development has been continually beginning over again on the frontier. This perennial rebirth, this fluidity of American life, this expansion westward with its new opportunities, its continuous touch with the simplicity of primitive society, furnish the forces dominating American character. The true point of view in the history of this nation is not the Atlantic coast, it is the Great West. . . . In this advance, the frontier is the outer edge of the wave\u2014the meeting point between savagery and civilization.\nFrederick Jackson Turner, historian, \"The Significance of the Frontier in American History,\" 1893\n\n[T]he history of the West is a study of a place undergoing conquest and never fully escaping its consequences. . . . Deemphasize the frontier and its supposed end, conceive of the West as a place and not a process, and Western American history has a new look. First, the American West was an important meeting ground, the point where Indian America, Latin America, Anglo-America, Afro-America, and Asia intersected. . . . Second, the workings of conquest tied these diverse groups into the same story. Happily or not, minorities and majorities occupied a common ground. Conquest basically involved the drawing of lines on a map, the definition and allocation of ownership (personal, tribal, corporate, state, federal, and international), and the evolution of land from matter to property.\nPatricia Nelson Limerick, historian, The Legacy of Conquest: The Unbroken Past of the American West, 1987",

In the earlier period, abolitionists focused more on gradual emancipation and colonization efforts, such as the American Colonization Society founded in 1816. However, by the 1830s, there was a shift towards more radical and immediate abolitionist tactics, such as the formation of the American Anti-Slavery Society in 1833 and the publication of abolitionist newspapers like The Liberator by William Lloyd Garrison.\n\n(B) One specific historical similarity between the antislavery movement in the period 1780-1810 and in the period 1830-1859 is the use of moral and religious arguments to support the abolitionist cause. Both periods saw abolitionists invoking principles of liberty, equality, and Christian morality to argue against the institution of slavery. Abolitionists in both periods believed that slavery was a moral evil that went against the principles of justice and humanity.\n\n(C) One specific historical effect of the antislavery movement in the period 1830-1859 was the increased polarization of American society over the issue of slavery. The abolitionist movement, with its more radical tactics and uncompromising stance against slavery, contributed to heightened tensions between the North and South. This polarization ultimately played a significant role in leading to the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861.\n\nIn the image, I see a group of abolitionists gathered together, holding signs that read \"End Slavery Now\" and \"Abolish Slavery.\" Some individuals are also holding chains, symbolizing the shackles of slavery. The group appears to be participating in a protest or demonstration, advocating for the immediate abolition of slavery.
