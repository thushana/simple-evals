He was at first permitted to preach in some of our churches; but the clergy, taking a dislike to him, soon refused him their pulpits, and he was obliged to preach in the fields. The multitudes of all sects and denominations that attended his sermons were enormous. . . . It was wonderful to see the change soon made in the manners of our inhabitants.

Washington's advice in his Farewell Address advocated for neutrality and avoiding entangling alliances, which was contrary to the Federalist Party's pro-British stance and desire for closer ties with Great Britain. The Federalists, led by Alexander Hamilton, generally favored a stronger central government and closer economic and political relations with Britain, which directly contradicts Washington's warning against excessive partiality for foreign nations.",

Excessive partiality for one foreign nation and excessive dislike of another cause those whom they actuate to see danger only on one side and serve to veil and even second the arts of influence on the other. . . . The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to foreign nations, is in extending our commercial relations to have with them as little political connection as possible. So far as we have already formed engagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let us stop. Europe has a set of primary interests which to us have none, or a very remote relation. Hence she must be engaged in frequent controversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns.\"\nGeorge Washington, Farewell Address, 1796",
