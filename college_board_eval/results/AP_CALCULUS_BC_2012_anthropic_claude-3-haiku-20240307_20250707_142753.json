We are asked to find the limit as x approaches 1 of the expression (\u222b\u2081\u02e3 g(t) dt) / (g(x) - 6).\n\nUsing the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we can rewrite the expression as:\nlim (g(x) - g(1)) / (g(x) - 6)\nx\u21921\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\nlim (g(x) - 6) / (g(x) - 6)\nx\u21921\n\nThis simplifies to:\nlim 1 = 1/2\nx\u21921\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 1/2.",
