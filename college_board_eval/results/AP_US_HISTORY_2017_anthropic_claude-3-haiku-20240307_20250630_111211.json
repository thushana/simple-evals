He was at first permitted to preach in some of our churches; but the clergy, taking a dislike to him, soon refused him their pulpits, and he was obliged to preach in the fields. The multitudes of all sects and denominations that attended his sermons were enormous. . . . It was wonderful to see the change soon made in the manners of our inhabitants.

However, this approach began to shift with Woodrow Wilson's support for international democratic principles and the League of Nations during World War I, marking a significant departure from the more isolationist stance advocated by Washington. This shift towards greater global engagement and the promotion of democratic ideals represented a major turning point in U.S. foreign policy, moving away from the recommendations outlined in Washington's address.",
