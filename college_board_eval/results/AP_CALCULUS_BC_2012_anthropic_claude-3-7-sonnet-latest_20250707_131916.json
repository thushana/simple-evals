The numerator \u222b\u2081\u02e3 g(t)dt approaches 0 as x\u21921, and the denominator g(x)-6 also approaches 0. Applying L'H\u00f4pital's rule, the derivative of the numerator is g(x) and the derivative of the denominator is g'(x), giving us g(1)/g'(1) = 6/3 = 2. However, this is incorrect - we need to use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which gives us g(x) for the numerator's derivative, resulting in g(1)/g'(1) = 6/6 = 1.",
